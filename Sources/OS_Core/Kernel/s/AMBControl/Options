;Bin pages by physical address, for quick mapping from page number to
;physical address. Bin entry holds physical address of first page in bin.
;Bin size must be no bigger than minimum physical RAM fragment to be found
;in machine. eg. 512k size gives 128 pages in a bin, so shift of 7 and
;mask of &7F. Max practical bin size is 1M (mask must be immediate constant).
